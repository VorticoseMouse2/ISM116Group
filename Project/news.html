      <h3>Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord</h3>
        <p>After five years in development, there’s plenty of scope for rampant anticipation from the small glimpses we have had of the game, showing off everything from mounted combat to full-scale castle sieges, and even some of the game’s strategic elements like taking over caravan routes. Many diehard fans are still holding onto the hope that the game which was announced back in 2012 will be released before the end of the year. But, if you are like me you will still be waiting for the game even with the turn of yet another year. <br><br>
    	   TaleWorlds Entertainment is continuing to maintain the open-ended sandbox gameplay. Where you will still lead a group of followers around a medieval sandbox, fighting bandits, fulfilling the wishes of nobles and trying to make a name for yourself by unifying warring factions and bringing peace to Calradia. Of course, you can still live the life of a lone adventurer; abjuring the orders of your lord or king in favor of forming your own war party. In essence, Bannerlord is all about making your own way in a fluid and reactive medieval sandbox, fighting bandits, fulfilling the wishes of nobles and trying to make a name for yourself by unifying warring factions and bring peace to Calradia.

While microtransactions are a business tactic that have been around for quite a while, this tactic is being introduced into the PC world of gaming at an ever alarming rate. In games such as the recent release of Warner Bros. Interactive’s Middle Earth: Shadow of War back in september, the creation club in Fallout 4, and the ever continuous attempts of Bethesda’s implementation of paid mods built by the community in Skyrim.
